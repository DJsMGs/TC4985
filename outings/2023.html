          <p><img class="med" src="images/DriveItDay2023.jpg">I collected Angela from outside the Methodist Church (in the drizzle) and we drove to Parham House for the WSMGOC Drive It Day run. We were a little late, but there was quite a good turnout, with most people sheltering under the gazebo. After a while the rain eased and we all went into the garden. We took our lunch with us and found a quite, sheltered spot to eat it. Then we wandered around the garden and part of the grounds. Some people also went into the house.</p>
          <p>The run, there and back, was only 20 miles.</p>

          <p>So far this year, the weather hasn't been kind and when it was fine we were doing something else! Therefore, up till now the runs have mainly been test runs or local visits, apart from 'Drive It Day' (see above) when it rained.</p>
          <p>Today, however, I took the TC on a Wanderers run. Due to the weather, David F-B and I went on the last run in his TR4A. Although the forecast was for showers, the sun was shining this morning and I drove to Lyminster to pick up David and then we went on to Denmans Gardens at Fontwell to meet up with the other Wanderers. That was 25 miles, then we did a 30 mile run, with lots of twists and turns, to Chichester Yacht Club for lunch. Of course, I then had to take David home and return home myself. I drove a total of 92 miles and the car ran well. We had the hood down until we got to the yacht club. It was starting to drizzle as we arrived, so the hood went up. We kept the hood up on the way back, although it didn't start raining until I left David's.</p>
          <p>Overall, a good, but tiring outing.</p>

          <p><img class="med" src="images/SussexOak.jpg">We were away in June and so this was the first opportunity to take the TC on a longish run for a couple of months. David F-B drove here in his Rover and then we took the TC to the Sussex Oak at Warnham, near Horsham to meet up with the other Wanderers. We had a short shower on the way, but just kept driving. The run was through some Surrey country lanes, which were quite twisty. The run of about 28 miles brought us back to the Sussex Oak for lunch. I was home by 3:30, having driven the TC for 70 miles.</p>

          <h2 id="SW0809">Sussex Wanderers, Ashington to Maplehurst - 9th August</h2>
          <p>This was the annual Sussex Wanderers barbecue at the White Horse in Maplehurst. During a period of very unsettled weather, it was a dry, mainly sunny day. David F-B couldn't make it, so Marting Greenhalgh joined me as navigator. We met at the Red Lion in Ashington and then did a short-ish run to Maplehurst. There had been another road closure, so the last part was altered.</p>
          <p>Since the start and finish were both quite close, we only did a total of 44 miles, but the TC ran well and it was a very good barbecue.</p>

          <h2 id="PR0825">WSMGOC Pub Run, Sir Roger Tichbourne, Alfold Bars - 25th August</h2>
          <p><img class="med" src="images/IMG_0606.jpg">It is 20 miles from home to the Sir Roger Titchbourne. It was a sunny day, so it was a good run. Although we were only the second to arrive (the first in a Humber), other MGs soon arrived. There were 20 of us out on the terrace for a good meal and conversation. Then it was another 20 miles home, mainly in sunshine.</p>
          <p>Our TC is parked up near the pub, so out of sight. Harvey arrived in his TC and parked near us. The landlady got all the MGs to park on one side, although quite a few had to park in the middle.</p>
