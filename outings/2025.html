          <p><img class="med" src="images/WestDean.png">Last summer, not only were we away for some of the time, but TC4985 was at Milestone Classics at Wisborough Green so that they could try to find a buyer. They didn't! But it meant that I missed a number of runs, including the South Downs Run (although I marshalled and Angela helped in the cafe). In the spring of this year I discovered that two of the brake slave cylinders were leaking, so decided to replace them all, along with the flexible hoses. So this was the first real outing of the year.</p>
          <p>It was a fine, sunny day, albeit a little chilly, and I started by driving to Lyminster, via Long Furlong, to pick up David F-B, who was going to navigate. Due to a long queue at Crossbush we took a more scenic route to West Dean, where we met up with the rest of the Wanderers. So far that was 38 miles. After coffee and a chat we went off on the circular route shown here, another 32.5 miles, before lunch.</p>
          <p>David needed to go to Petworth to pick up his TR4A from a garage, so I dropped him there and then drove home via Pulborough and Storrington. In total the TC did 105 miles and ran very well.</p>
